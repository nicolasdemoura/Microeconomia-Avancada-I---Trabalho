  abstract = {We consider the problem of inference in shift-share research designs. The choice between existing approaches that allow for unrestricted spatial correlation involves tradeoffs, varying in terms of their validity when there are relatively few or concentrated shocks, and in terms of the assumptions on the shock assignment process and treatment effects heterogeneity. We propose alternative randomization inference methods that combine the advantages of different approaches. These methods are valid in finite samples under relatively stronger assumptions, while asymptotically valid under weaker assumptions.},

  abstract = {Many recent papers in political science and economics use rainfall as a strategy to facilitate causal inference. Rainfall shocks are as-if randomly assigned, but the assignment of rainfall by county is highly correlated across space. Since clustered assignment does not occur within well-defined boundaries, it is challenging to estimate the variance of the effect of rainfall on political outcomes. I propose using randomization inference with historical weather patterns from 73 years as potential randomizations. I replicate the influential work on rainfall and voter turnout in presidential elections in the United States by Gomez, Hansford, and Krause (2007) and compare the estimated average treatment effect (ATE) to a sampling distribution of estimates under the sharp null hypothesis of no effect. The alternate randomizations are random draws from national rainfall patterns on election and would-be election days, which preserve the clustering in treatment assignment and eliminate the need to simulate weather patterns or make assumptions about unit boundaries for clustering. I find that the effect of rainfall on turnout is subject to greater sampling variability than previously estimated using conventional standard errors.},

However, scholars generally justify the exclusion restriction based on its plausibility. I propose a method for searching for additional violations implied by existing social science studies. I show that the use of weather to instrument different independent variables represents strong prima facie evidence of exclusion-restriction violations for all weather-IV studies. A review of 289 studies reveals 194 variables previously linked to weather: all representing potential exclusion-restriction violations. Using sensitivity analysis, I show that the magnitude of many of these violations is sufficient to overturn numerous existing IV results. I conclude with practical steps to systematically review existing literature to identify and quantify possible exclusion-restriction violations when using IV designs.},

The interval has the familiar ``estimator plus and minus a standard error times a critical value'' form, but we propose new methods for constructing the standard error and the critical value. The standard error is constructed using population principal components from a given ``worst-case'' spatial correlation model. The critical value is chosen to ensure coverage in a benchmark parametric model for the spatial correlations. The method is shown to control coverage in finite sample Gaussian settings in a restricted but nonparametric class of models and in large samples whenever the spatial correlation is weak, that is, with average pairwise correlations that vanish as the sample size gets large. We also provide results on the efficiency of the method.},

Spatial dependence in the volatility may arise due to spatial spillovers among locations; that is, in the case of positive spatial dependence, if two locations are in close proximity, they can exhibit similar volatilities. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of the recent literature on spatial and spatiotemporal volatility models. We first briefly review time series volatility models and their multivariate extensions to motivate their spatial and spatiotemporal counterparts. We then review various spatial and spatiotemporal volatility specifications proposed in the literature along with their underlying motivations and estimation strategies. Through this analysis, we effectively compare all models and provide practical recommendations for their appropriate usage. We highlight possible extensions and conclude by outlining directions for future~research.},

  abstract = {As the climate warms, the consequent moistening of the atmosphere increases extreme precipitation. Precipitation variability should also increase, producing larger wet-dry swings, but that is yet to be confirmed observationally. Here we show that precipitation variability has already grown globally (over 75\% of land area) over the past century, as a result of accumulated anthropogenic warming. The increased variability is seen across daily to intraseasonal timescales, with daily variability increased by 1.2\% per 10 years globally, and is particularly prominent over Europe, Australia, and eastern North America. Increased precipitation variability is driven mainly by thermodynamics linked to atmospheric moistening, modulated at decadal timescales by circulation changes. Amplified precipitation variability poses new challenges for weather and climate predictions, as well as for resilience and adaptation by societies and ecosystems.           ,              Editor's summary                            As climate change continues, warming of the atmosphere allows it to hold more water and thus produce more precipitation. A corollary to more rain is the amplification of precipitation variability, a behavior easier to predict than to observe. Zhang               et al               . used global records of daily precipitation to show that this expected increase in precipitation variability is in fact detectable in the data over the past century. This trend, which is most prominent over Europe, Australia, and eastern North America, will make adaptation more difficult for societies and ecosystems. ---Jesse Smith},

  abstract = {Consider a researcher estimating the parameters of a regression function based on data for all 50 states in the United States or on data for all visits to a website. What is the interpretation of the estimated parameters and the standard errors? In practice, researchers typically assume that the sample is randomly drawn from a large population of interest and report standard errors that are designed to capture sampling variation. This is common even in applications where it is difficult to articulate what that population of interest is, and how it differs from the sample. In this article, we explore an alternative approach to inference, which is partly design-based. In a design-based setting, the values of some of the regressors can be manipulated, perhaps through a policy intervention. Design-based uncertainty emanates from lack of knowledge about the values that the regression outcome would have taken under alternative interventions. We derive standard errors that account for design-based uncertainty instead of, or in addition to, sampling-based uncertainty. We show that our standard errors in general are smaller than the usual infinite-population sampling-based standard errors and provide conditions under which they coincide.},
